## These are the rules and terms ALL users must abide by:

1. The EFI folders are for personal use ONLY. You may use them for yourself, a friend, a family member or someone close to you.
2. DO NOT use the EFI folders commercially. The only public use allowed is for a guide or YouTube video. If you create a guide and use my EFI folder to Hackintosh, please DO NOT upload the folder to the guide, rather, provide a link to my website and credit me.
3. This website may be used as a template, provided you remove the images from the folders, they are under MY rights, except for images such as the backarrow (see below).

## Credits and attributions:
